# ⚙️ Fatigue Life Estimation Framework

**Objective:** Develop a framework to calculate fatigue properties for different materials.  

**Tools Used:** Python, nCode, Material Database  

**Highlights:**
- Automated fatigue constants calculation (b1, b2, SRI1) based on UTS and material type  
- XML export for direct use in nCode  
- Handles multiple materials per CSV file  

**Outcome:**  
Significantly reduced manual effort and ensured consistency in fatigue calculations.
